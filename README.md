# NASA-pic-of-the-day-Android-App-CST2335-Final-Project
Final project for CST2335 Mobile Android Development.
The main function of this project is an app that easily allows the user to view NASA's 'Pictures of the Day' and save them to a favourites list.
- Calendar view to select the day you wish to view.
- Option to save the picture locally.

Note: There were requirements that needed to be met for this assignment that seem like odd design choices.
